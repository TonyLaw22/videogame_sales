# Video Games Analysis
by Antoni Lawrence

## Dataset

This dataset is from Kaggle, and shows the sales of a number of popular video games since 1980. For each game, we are provided with its Platform, Year, Publisher and its sales totals from 4 seperate regions, along with its overall Global sales.

## My Process

For this assignment, I first needed to clean the data so that it was ready to be analysed in the form of aggregate functions and graphical visualisations. 

During this assignment, the PyCharm libraries I imported were Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib and Seaborn, while I also needed to import a Warnings library to avoid any "Future Warnings" tags at the bottom of my visualisation.

I needed to make a note for every step of the process (Markdowns) to paint a clearer picture to the reader about what was happening with the coding and visualisations that were being presented.

And at the end, I needed to draw conclusions on the findings from the data and visualisations.
